I am passionate about addressing your organisation's marketing and communications needs whether it is through a marketing strategy, advertising, sponsorship, social media or public relations.

I currently work at public policy consultancy Aither as their Marketing Coordinator and Graphic Designer responsible for managing digital channels and generating collateral.

I previously worked at the Australian and New Zealand Institute of Insurance and Finance (ANZIIF) as their Digital Marketing Executive, providing SEM, SEO, Analytics and social media management assistance. </p> <p>

From 2017-2018 I worked at The Lead Agency, a B2B marketing and lead generation company located in East Melbourne, with a diverse and high profile client base.

Before accepting the role of Digital Copywriter, I was running my own marketing and web business with a small yet loyal client base.

Previous to running my own business, I left a Public Relations Consultant role at Market Creations, a large regional Midwest marketing agency.

I have two post-graduate qualifications from RMIT: a Graduate Diploma in Public Relations (Distinction) and a Masters of Communications (Distinction). During that time I was involved in several projects with not-for-profit and art companies, where I developed specialist skills in Marketing and Communications - specifically Public Relations. </p><p>

In 2014, I was a finalist in Google's 2014 Social Media Online Marketing Awards and ran a three month social media and online marketing campaign for local business Monarch Cakes' 80th anniversary.

In 2013 I interned with artist agency RTIST and worked with not-for-profit Lentil As Anything in developing a strategic communications plan for the launch of packaged lentils.

I look forward to working with you on your Marketing and Communications solutions!
